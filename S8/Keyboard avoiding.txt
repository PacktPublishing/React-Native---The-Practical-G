KeyboardAvoidingView and ScrollView
Section 8, Lecture 127
Depending on which device you're using, you might encounter an issue on the SharePlace screen: The input for the place name might not scroll up when typing. Your soft keyboard might overlap it.

You can of course also use KeyboardAvoidingView  here. Actually, adding it should be super simple:

1) Add it to the imports

2) Replace the wrapping <View>  with <KeyboardAvoidingView behavior="padding" style={styles.container}> 

The problem just is the ScrollView . Your content won't scroll up automatically - but you can do that manually. So the input can be made visible.

Once you close the keyboard though, the padding is likely to stick around.

That's because ScrollView  + KeyboardAvoidingView  don't work together very well.
